  The metaverse is employed as an immersive educational tool to help users understand the modern day realities of historically redlined neighborhoods in Oaklandâ€™s Alameda county. 
  The experience begins by asking the user to enter their race and income. Based on extensive research, the user is spawned within a realistic, immersive 3D world streamed by the Cesium plugin for Unreal. 
  This leads to a very visceral contrast between a tree lined neighborhood with birds chirping or buildings next to train tracks with not a park in sight. Spatial datums educate the user by sharing information such as the number of grocery vs liquor stores in a neighborhood.
