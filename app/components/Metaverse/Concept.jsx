  The metaverse is employed as an immersive educational tool to help users understand the modern day realities of historically redlined neighborhoods in Oaklandâ€™s Alameda county. 

  The experience begins by asking the user to enter their race and income. Based on extensive research, the user is spawned within a realistic, immersive 3D world streamed by the Cesium plugin for Unreal. 
  This leads to a very visceral contrast between a tree lined neighborhood with birds chirping or buildings next to train tracks with not a park in sight. Spatial datums educate the user by sharing information such as the number of grocery vs liquor stores in a neighborhood.

  EDIT:
  what if someone from another city could explore the neighborhoods that aren't accessible to them. Learn why some neighborhoods have such few tress, are near highways, and fewer resources. 
  People study neighborhood health and that information isn't always readily accesible.
  Bring those findings to the user to mobilize, quesiton, get involved.
