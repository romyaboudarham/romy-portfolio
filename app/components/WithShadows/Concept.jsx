            When this project was assigned, I was 6 months into grieving the sudden death of my brother. 
            As more and more time passed, I wrestled with how to share my life with people who never experienced a close, personal loss of this magnitude.

              I was eager make my first VR project in Unity and also wanted to honor my current emotion state, so I became curious to see if I could use this technology creatively to process my grief and tell a story that builds empathy and understanding for every day complexities of grief.

              I started by exploring what kind of empathy-driven storytelling, point of view (POV), immersive, interactive digital experiences are out there.
              From there I sought out what people wished others knew more about grief. Then I turned inward and explored my own grief through journalling, talking with family, meditating, crying, and reading.
