            During San Francisco's Industrial Boom, Irish Hill was once a small, lively working-class neighborhood of Irish immigrants employed primarily at the Union Iron Works shipping yard nearby. During WWI, the hill and its residents were displaced to make way for shipyard expansion. I chose to make an Augmented Reality monument to the workers who were swept away by the exploitation and power imbalance inherent to capitalism.
